Placeholder Read Me for the Urban PV Panel Optimization Github!

This is an end-to-end pipeline that will be able to detect existing rooftops and PV panels from arial sattelite images, compute the solar/PV panel potential of those rooftops, and then export the optimal mix of rooftops to install PV panels on to meet a user-specific electric capacity amount.
